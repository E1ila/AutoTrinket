# AutoTrinket
WoW 1.12 Addon - Automatic replace trinket according to cooldown remaining.

# Usage

When running the first time, write `/at a` to add the currently equipped trinkets to the list. The order of insertion is the priority order to be used later on, so start with the most important trinkets, when the top one is first. After adding the first two (or one), you can equip the next trinkets you wish to add, then type `/at a` again.

* You can always clear your trinket list with `/at c` and readd.
* Disable the addon with `/at d` or enable it with `/at e`.
* Type `/at p` to print monitored trinkets and their current cooldowns.
* Write `/at` at any time for help.
